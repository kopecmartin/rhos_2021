This dir contains subunit files created by Tempest.
These subunit files can be used to generate a StackViz report.
Each of the subunit files contains a different number of workers -
one worker is basically one thread the tests were executed by in a given
test run. In other words, the number of workers means how many tests were
executed in parallel.
